# for this to run you will need:
# Node.js
# Jenkins (by default it works on port 8080)
# Ngrok (to expose the port 8080 in the internet)
# Github repo with the project
# Webhook from the repo (for payload you will need ngrok, but by default you can use localhost:8080)

# install dependencies and run the project
npm install
npm start
# error will occur, because Jenkins is already running on port 8080
# you can change it in index.js file just for run and test (to see if everything is working)
# if you see docker files port 3030 must be exposed

# for building image and uploading it to dockerhub
# we will use chebushev/jenkins-test:alpha for testing purposes
docker build -t chebishev/jenkins-test:alpha .
echo "$DOCKER_PASSWORD" | docker login --username chebishev --password "Your Generated Key from DockerHub"

# for running the image
docker pull chebishev/jenkins-test:alpha
