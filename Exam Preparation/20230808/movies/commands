npm install
npm audit fix
npm run test:unit
npx playwright install
npm run test:ui

# after that change "h2" to "h1" in "about.test.js"
# it fixes two of the tests

# in the footer.test.js one of the "e" letters isn't in english (maybe cyrilic)
# 3 of 6 fixed

# in the header.test.js "Home" is the first link and not "Movie Collection"
# 4 of 6 fixed

# replace "Welcome" with "Movies Collection" on home.test.js
# 5 of 6 fixed

# fix the link in movies.test.js to "http://localhost:8080/movies"
# 6 of 6 fixed

# next steps are:
# create ci with "npm install" and "npm run test:unit"
# create cd with deploy to render (get api key and service_id from render.com)
# create another job to run the ui test, but before that fix the link
